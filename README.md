# Run A Python Script On AWS Forever (For Free)
Run a python script on an EC2 instance (on AWS) forever, for FREE!

<br> 

## Step 1: Have your code
* Have some python code that can run all the time (in a `while true:` loop or otherwise)
  * Note: this can also work with code that needs to be re-run all the time, but will not work with code that should only be run once a day, or once every `x` horus. That code should be moved to a sceduler script, and that's the script that should be used here.
  * This project will be using [The Math DiscordBot](https://github.com/JacobNoahGlik/MathDiscordBot) as an example.

## Step 2: Create a free AWS account
* Go to [sign up for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email) and create your free account
  * Note: you may need to attach a credit card to this account, and a $1 hold may be placed on the account for 3 business days to make sure they have the ability to charge you in case you start using paid services. But as long as you use free cervices (as outlined in this readme), you will not be charged.

## Step 3: Create a new EC2 instance.
